Let's begin by bringing your attention to your breath. Don't try to change it, just notice the natural rhythm of each inhale and exhale. Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest or the sensation of the breath at your nostrils. (Pause) As you focus on your breath, you might notice thoughts arising – worries, to-do lists, plans for later. That’s completely natural. Simply acknowledge them without judgment and gently guide your attention back to your breath. (Pause) Now, expand your awareness to include the sensations of your body. Notice any areas of tension or relaxation. Feel the weight of your body resting on the chair. (Pause) Sounds may also come into your awareness – the hum of the computer, voices in the distance. Acknowledge these sounds without letting them pull you away from the present moment. (Pause) Continue focusing on your breath and your senses for the next couple of minutes. Returning your attention to the present moment whenever your mind wanders. (Longer pause, approximately 2 minutes) Now, gently shift your attention back to the room around you. Notice any sounds or sensations. When you're ready, open your eyes. That was a quick 5-minute mindfulness meditation. Remember, even short practices like this, done regularly, can make a big difference in managing stress and improving your focus. How do you feel?"
